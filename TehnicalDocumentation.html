            <p>Fashion is a dynamic and ever-evolving form of self-expression, encompassing clothing, accessories,
                hairstyles, and even behavior. It reflects the cultural, social, and economic influences of a particular
                time and place, serving as a visual language through which individuals communicate their identity,
                status, and beliefs.</p>

            <p>Throughout history, fashion has played a crucial role in defining societal norms and trends. From the
                elaborate garments of ancient civilizations to the minimalist styles of the modern era, fashion has
                continually evolved, shaped by technological advancements, globalization, and changing attitudes.</p>

            <p>In addition to its aesthetic and cultural significance, fashion is also a multi-billion-dollar industry,
                encompassing design, manufacturing, marketing, and retail. Fashion designers, influencers, models,
                stylists, and photographers all contribute to shaping the narrative of what is considered stylish and
                desirable.</p>

            <header>Fashion Terminology</header>
            <p>Understanding fashion terminology is essential for anyone interested in the industry. Here are some
                common terms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><i>Haute Couture:</i> High-end fashion that is custom-made for individual clients, often using
                        luxurious materials and intricate craftsmanship.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><i>Ready-to-Wear:</i> Mass-produced clothing that is available in standard sizes and sold in
                        retail stores.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><i>Hairstyle:</i> A particular way in which a person's hair is cut and styled.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><i>Trendsetter:</i> A person or group that influences others by setting new fashion trends.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><i>Accessory:</i> An item that complements and enhances a person's outfit, such as jewelry,
                        handbags, scarves, and belts.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><i>Asymmetric styling:</i> Designs in which each side of an item of apparel is different in
                        structure than the other side. In a symmetrical design, both sides are the same. Asymmetry may
                        be
                        seen in areas such as collars, necklines, closings or hemlines.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><i>Agile manufacturing:</i> Apparel manufacturing that utilizes a modular production system. In
                        modular production workers are organized into teams that work together to produce an entire
                        garment.
                        In contrast to the bundle system, in which one worker performs an assembly task, then bundles
                        the
                        materials together and passes them to another worker who does another task, the modular system
                        is
                        more efficient and flexible.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><i>Brand and trademark:</i> A brand is a name, label, or mark assigned to a product by its
                        manufacturer or distributor. A trademark is a word, design, or device assigned to a product or
                        service by the owner. Trademarks can be registered so that no other individual or company can
                        use
                        the name or symbol. A brand can be a trademark if it is registered with the U.S. Patent and
                        Trademark Office of the Department of Commerce. U.S. law requires that goods or services being
                        trademarked must actually have been sold, so trademarks cannot be selected and registered in
                        advance
                        of their use. In many other countries, items can be trademarked before being used. Commonly used
                        general terms, such as “silk,” “pants,” or “beauty” cannot be trademarked. Registered trademarks
                        are
                        designated with symbols. The symbols are ®, which is only used once the trademark has been
                        registered; ™, a trademark for goods, and SM, a trademark for services. Registered trademarks
                        are
                        protected for a period of 20 years and are renewable.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><i>CAD/CAM/CIM:</i> Each of these three acronyms refers to computer based technology used for the
                        design and/or manufacture of apparel. Specifically, CAD stands for computer-aided-design, CAM
                        for
                        computer-aided manufacturing, and CIM for computer integrated manufacturing. CAD computer
                        programs
                        support the design phase and give the designer the ability to experiment with ideas about
                        styles,
                        colors, fabrics, etc. CAM programs support the tasks related to manufacture, and with CAD/CAM in
                        combination, the design can move from design to preparation of the pattern, making the master
                        plan
                        for cutting the garment, grading patterns to different sizes, cutting the fabric, and sewing.
                        CIM
                        overcomes the problems that may occur when it is necessary to move the data from the design and
                        manufacturing process to the next step. In computer-integrated-manufacturing, the various
                        programs
                        communicate directly, so that data moves smoothly along the production process in an accurate
                        and
                        timely fashion.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><i>Generic fiber name:</i> Name for a natural or manufactured textile fiber or group of fibers
                        that
                        has been established by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for classification and regulatory
                        purposes. Examples of natural fiber names include cotton, silk, and wool, which includes all
                        types
                        of animal hair fibers. Manufactured fibers are classified by their chemical structure and
                        include
                        fiber groups such as nylon, polyester, and acrylic. Different manufacturers produce variations
                        of
                        the generic fiber that that may be assigned a trademark name. For example, spandex is a generic
                        fiber category and Lycra™ is a trademarked name of a spandex fiber.</p>
